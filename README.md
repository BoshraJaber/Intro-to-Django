# Introduction to Django
* Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. 
* Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It's free and open source.
* What is Django used for?
 - Django can be (and has been) used to build almost any type of website â€” from content management systems and wikis, through to social networks and news sites. 
 - It can work with any client-side framework, and can deliver content in almost any format (including HTML, RSS feeds, JSON, XML, etc)

## "opinionated" framework:
* Django is "somewhat opinionated", and hence delivers the "best of both worlds". 
* It provides a set of components to handle most web development tasks and one (or two) preferred ways to use them.

## how to code it:
1. `poetry add django`
2. `django-admin help` : 
 - we can use it to start new project: `django-admin startproject project_name .` where the dot means this folder
3. "manage.py": is the entry point to run administrative tasks, we can run it as script( `python manage.py`), 
4. __pycache__ : I should add it to .gitignore, It will be created when I run my code.
5. inside "urls.py" there is "urlpatterns" where I can add my urls, and what code should run 
6. "settings.py": most important file, most sections are documented
 - INSTALLED_APPS: used to add functionality

7. Running the server:
 - `python manager.py runserver`
 - `python manage.py migrate` , now it created tables inside our db
 - db.sqlite : a type of db, it is a light version of sql, It is in a file instead of being on a server. I can see its content : "DB Browers for SQlight"
 - in terminal: ` sqlite3` to enter its shell
 - `.show`
 - `.open db.sqlite3`
 - `.quit`

8. Starting the app:
 - `python manage.py startapp its_name`
 - model.py: Here it goes my structre of data.
 - migration:contains migrations, an empty
 - admin.py: I used it if I want to register model I create with the admin panel.
 - app.py
9. I run the server again and I open: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

10. to create a superuser: `python manage.sy createsuperuser`, then we enter the required info
11. in view.py: 
`from django.views.generic import TemplateView`
`class HomePageView(TemplateView):`
   ` template_name = 'home.html'`
12. create "urls.py" inside things folder, I imported and added `HomePageView`
13. in the original urls.py: 
` path('', include('things.urls')),`
14. create template folder with two files(base, home)
15. in settings.py: add DIr to TEMPLETES variable

11. create a model:
12. regester it to an admin




* my app has a url, url tells it which view to use, view is telling it which template to load
